# FTO-SORT

The FTO-SORT system leverages the [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) model as its primary detector for accurate object identification and incorporates a tracking mechanism based on modifications and enhancements of the [BoT-SORT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14651) and [BoxMOT](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/boxmot/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file). By integrating and customizing these existing tracking frameworks, the system achieves improved detection precision and robust object tracking, tailored to the specific requirements of the application.

For evaluating tracking accuracy, the [TrackEval GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/TrackEval) was utilized.

This is a brief description of my project.
